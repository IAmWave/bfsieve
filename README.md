# Brainfuck Sieve of Eratosthenes

[The Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes), implemented in [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck), the most famous esoteric programming language. It takes a single ASCII character as input, interprets it as an integer N and then prints out all primes not larger than N.

sieve.commented.bf contains a brief description of how the algorithm functions, while sieve.min.bf is a "minified" version without any comments or whitespace.

I wrote this in the summer of 2014 when I was bored on holiday. The whole thing was written from my phone. It could certainly be optimized but I believe that is not what Brainfuck is about.
